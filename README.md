### Python-challenge

### Background
In this project I utilized the concepts learned to complete two Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where Python scripting skills can come in handy.

### PyBank: Revenue

In this challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, the company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

My job was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

My analysis looked similar to the one below:

### PyPoll: Vote-Counting

In this challenge, I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.

My analysis looked similar to the one below:

In addition, the final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.
